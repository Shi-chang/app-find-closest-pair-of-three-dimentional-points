# Overview
Finding the closest pair of three-dimensional points normally takes O(n2) running time. The algorithm applied in the program uses the methodology of divide and conquer. It is able to find the pair of three-dimensional points with shortest Euclidean distance among the points provided in O(n*logn) time.
